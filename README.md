# QueueImplementation

A simple Python implementation of a queue data structure. This project demonstrates the fundamental operations of a queue, including enqueue, dequeue, peek, and size, as well as methods to display the current state of the queue.

## Features

- **Enqueue**: Add an item to the end of the queue.
- **Dequeue**: Remove and return the item from the front of the queue.
- **Peek**: View the item at the front of the queue without removing it.
- **Size**: Get the number of items in the queue.
- **Display**: Print the current state of the queue.

## Installation

To use the Queue implementation, simply clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/QueueImplementation.git

Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd QueueImplementation

No additional dependencies are required to run this implementation.
Usage

Here is an example of how to use the Queue class:

python

from Queue import Queue

if __name__ == "__main__":
    q = Queue()
    q.enqueue("Order 1")
    q.enqueue("Order 2")
    
    print("Current queue:")
    q.display()  # Output: Current queue: ['Order 1', 'Order 2']

    print("Dequeued:", q.dequeue())  # Output: Order 1 your order is ready
    print("Next in queue:", q.peek())  # Output: Order 2
    print("Size of queue:", q.size())  # Output: 1
