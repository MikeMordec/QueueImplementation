Usage

Here is an example of how to use the Queue class:

python

from Queue import Queue

if __name__ == "__main__":
    q = Queue()
    q.enqueue("Order 1")
    q.enqueue("Order 2")
    
    print("Current queue:")
    q.display()  # Output: Current queue: ['Order 1', 'Order 2']

    print("Dequeued:", q.dequeue())  # Output: Order 1 your order is ready
    print("Next in queue:", q.peek())  # Output: Order 2
    print("Size of queue:", q.size())  # Output: 1
